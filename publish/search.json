It draws parallels between the Australian situation and international responses to the global housing crisis. By examining historical initiatives, the presentation highlights the continuity of housing challenges throughout the years. The inefficiencies in the existing housing planning and delivery system in New South Wales are exposed, emphasizing the urgent need for transformation. Key issues are 1) the misalignment between projections and targets; 2) the inadequacy of local government areas as housing market areas; and 3) the misconception that rezoning land guarantees supply. We emphasise the importance of adopting a housing market area approach, considering internal migration patterns, and embracing stakeholder engagement for adaptive management. Systemic improvements are urgently required to deliver sustainable solutions and avoid future housing crises."

That’s because this system is linear, complex, and relies on several interdependencies.

As part of the ‘Common Planning Assumptions’, the projections are required to inform state agencies’ service and asset planning, and Councils’ local strategies.\nBut how do these projections perform over time? The Hunter Research Foundation Centre dataset includes historic Government projections. This slide below uses those to show how the ‘growth story’ we tell ourselves about the region has changed in less than a decade. The hatched columns are the projected population levels, as updated every 3 years since 2016. Where we thought we’d grow to by 2036 back in 2019 (shown in yellow) was 63,000 people less than what was last projected in 2022 (shown in red). The solid blue tracks how the Hunter’s population has actually grown according to census data since 2006. The trendline shows how close we’re tracking against what was projected based on past performance. This indicates that it is entirely possible that we could achieve higher growth levels than have previously been projected."

But this is given to us in the number of ‘implied dwellings’ published alongside the population projections.\nThe dwellings projections are based on top down assumptions like household formation and bottom up assumptions like how much housing the existing zoned land can deliver.\nThis next slide singles out Newcastle and Lake Macquarie – the two largest local government areas in the Hunter by population. Like the slide before, it shows how much the projected dwellings have changed since 2016 –by around 5,000 houses in Lake Macquarie. The same data for Maitland would show a difference of around 12,000 houses. This is a fast-moving target to try and operationalise in a linear, complex, interdependent system!\nUnlike the population slide before, the actual versus projected dwellings trends indicate we could fall short of the number of houses we expect to require. If that is indeed a shortfall, it compounds every year, but that growing historic deficit isn’t picked up as additional need anywhere in our planning system – the updated projections each year keep us looking forward to future need, not historic needs. So, our ‘in practice’ target is never giving us the full picture.\n\nThe next three slides help illustrate what that oversight means in the Hunter’s ‘lived experience’."

From there, it mandates a governance arrangement to determine needs and agree targets, before operationalising these through policy or planning controls.\nDefining a market for a good is about understanding where a level of price uniformity exists in the context of transport cost. The difference being that in ‘goods’ markets, it is the product is that moves… but in a housing market, it’s the people that move.\nSo, here at the Institute, we’ve been playing around for the last several weeks to draw on examples from literature and practice, including guidelines from the UK and housing studies by SGS here in Australia to try and re-imagine a different spatial framework that might help us understand housing market needs more robustly."

It’s a complex and often highly personalised choice model …just think about your own motivations the last time you moved – was it:\n\nTo get into your preferred school catchment?\nTo be closer to your parents?\nTo get closer to the beach?\n\nAnd here in the Hunter, many households have traditionally opted to locate themselves between more than one centre to meet their specific needs – for example much of Maitland’s growth has been attributed to dual-income households with one person working in mining in the Upper Hunter and the other in health or education in the Lower Hunter.\nSo rather than journey to work, we drew from internal migration patterns using data from the last two census periods. That allows this map to tell us where people who are already local and need to change their house (but not uproot their whole lives) are more likely to search to meet their need.\nThis approach is different from the journey to work approach because it is likely to reflect more of the social, price-tag, and place-attachment drivers influencing people’s decisions about where to live.\nThe different colours show these migration-based ‘housing market areas’, and the white lines are local government area boundaries. This modelling showed time and again that in reality, people’s choice about where to live doesn’t stop at LGA boundaries.\n\nThe place-based solutions we urgently need to address the housing crises must be grounded in action, not just aspiration. Taking a housing market rather than LGA approach do this would make more sense by allowing:\n\nData to be collected and analysed at a level where the trends make sense in relation to the research questions you want to ask,\nGovernance to happen at an appropriate scale, and\nSolutions (be they policy or planning) to be suitably contextualised.\n\nThis configuration still needs some testing (and some more modelling in the MidCoast area), but we can already see a few advantages to the approach.\nJust picking up on Maitland in brown – mover behaviour shows a preference area reaching into both the Newcastle and Port Stephens local government areas and, I would hypothesise, the southern parts of Dungog around Clarence Town if we went more granular than the underlying SA2s we used as building blocks allowed.\nWe believe using these areas to frame housing needs assessments and governance arrangements would be far more effective than our current approach but putting this approach into practice, however, would require government funding and attention.\nI would argue this type of systems-based improvement is just as urgent a priority as addressing our infrastructure backlog if we truly want to deliver sustainable solutions."

Misalignment in the funding and delivery of infrastructure – for a long period of time the issue was with Hunter Water’s trunk infrastructure, and more recently the literal roadblock is proving to be Transport for NSW.\nLearning from that example, it was the organisational re-think that occurred within Hunter Water that made the difference in so far as they accepted their role in the Region’s growth story and repositioned their own strategic planning capacity and capabilities to do things differently. This is a lesson for all Government agencies responsible for assets that enable new housing projects to go ahead.\nBut, beyond infrastructure, there is a bigger, more systemic failure which is that we aren’t planning in the right way to truly deliver place-based solutions. We don’t even know the full picture of what we need to operationalise.\n\nSo, does it make sense to push billions of dollars of public sector money through this system and expect to achieve the results we need?"

Assuming an energy content of 29GJ/t and an emission factor of 90kg CO2-eq/GJ (National Greenhouse gas factors) gives an estimated emission of 409 Mt CO2-eq, or 88% of Australia’s territorial emissions (based on Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory: March 2023).\nThe IEA predicts global coal demand to plateau out to 2020. A decline in demand for coal in most advanced economies is being offset by a tight energy supply market (partly due to the Ukraine situation) raising prices, particularly for gas (IEA Coal report).Scenarios to 2030 by the IEA in the World Energy Outlook estimate a peak and decline to 2020 levels by 2030 for global coal demand in the stated policies scenario, a decline of 10% in the Announced Pledges Scenario, and a fall by 55% in the Net Zero Scenario.\nOne of the arguments regarding Hunter coal is that the emissions intensity is better than global average coal, and thus it should be one of the latter producers to exit the market.

They do not include the emissions that will be released when the coal is combusted overseas.\n\n\n\nTaking a “consumption” approach, we exclude those impacts embodied in exports, as they will be allocated to the final users of the coal. Doing so highlights the importance of households in demand-side mitigation options. The below figure categorises the Hunter carbon footprint by categories of final demand - these are the demand-side “drivers” of economic growth as classified in the national statistics, and include houshold consumption, government consumption, private and public investments (often in building stock, but also machinery and software that is used for productive purposes in future years), Government gross fixed captial expenditure and changes in inventories (e.g. when there is an increase in stockpiling of goods in a certain year.)\n\n\n\nHouseholds are responsible for almost 50%, whilst investments (mainly private) are significant (mainly construction of residential building stock)\n\nHousehold demand\nBelow is the breakdown of Household footprint, firstly aggregated to 17 sectors, before breaking down to 114 sectors\n\n\n\nAbove are aggregated results, with disaggregated results at the level of Australian input-output tables below.

GDP per capita fell 0.3% due to an uptick in migration post-COVID. The ABS Australian National Accounts: National Income, Expenditure and Product highlight the following points:\n\nDomestic demand has remained strong and been a primary upward driver of growth, providing a 0.7% increase in the quarter.\nCapital investment was the strongest contributor to domestic demand, providing a 0.5% point contribution to GDP growth.\nPublic investment increased by 8.2%. New machinery and equipment including motor vehicles was the biggest contributor.\nConsumption expenditure had a subdued 0.1% impact on GDP. There is an increasing shift away from discretionary expenditure to essential goods and services.\nNet trade was an upward driver this quarter due to exports increasing faster than imports. There was a 4.3% rise in exports, offsetting a 0.7% increase in imports. This was the opposite case in the previous quarter.\n\nPrices of traded commodities, especially rural goods, liquified natural gas and coal, have been falling is having a large impact on profits for the mining industry. Domestic prices have been rising strongly, mainly due to a tight labour market, fuelling price increases in services. (see ABS for more info)"

This figure is slightly less than the NSW-wide rate of 3.0% in July 2023, which has also only slightly declined in the last twelve months (down from 3.9%). The decline in the unemployment rate is partly driven by the increasing labour force participation rates over the period. That is, more people are seeking employment. The region’s youth unemployment rate has also seen record lows, with the unemployment rate for July 2023 at 2.9%. This figure is now below the NSW-wide rate of 3.7%. Historically, a key challenge for policymakers is to achieve a low rate of unemployment without fuelling excessive increases in wages growth and inflation. Economists call the lowest rate of unemployment that achieves this the ‘non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment’ or NAIRU. Current estimates are that this rate is roughly 5% in Australia.

The big increases seen post COVID have only started to recede in some LGAs. Hunter median prices fell by 2.2% in the second half of 2022 and another 2% in the first quarter of 2023. Initial data provided for the second and third quarter tend to support a further decline in line with this trend.\nThe fall contrasts sharply with the region’s yearly growth rate of over 20% per annum in 2021. Falls were led by the Port Stephens LGA, where house prices fell 4.3 per cent over the year, although a rebound is now visible. In Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, prices fell by 5% over the year, with falls of 3% in Newcastle for the last half-year. Singleton saw a drop of 16% in the last quarter of last year, but this is offsetting a spike in mid-2022 resulting in a +6% increase over 12 months.\nAmong Hunter LGAs, the Upper Hunter showed the largest price increases of 13% in the last 12 months. Muswellbrook is the only LGA that is not yet recording declines in house prices over the preceding 24 months. Prices here have seen growth of 27% in 2011 and 14% in 2022.\n\n\nData source: NSW Govt Rent and Sales Report\n\nRental prices\nRental prices may have just started to peak, with price rises reflecting those that have been seen in house sales for some time. The acceleration since 2021 is still high, with most Hunter LGAs seeing faster rises than Sydney or NSW.\nThe data below is for the median weekly rent for 3-bedroom stand-alone houses. Rental prices have tempered some of their increases. For example, the 12 months to March showed increases in the range of 14-26% across LGAs in the region whereas the most recent quarter (to June 2023) has seen decreases in some LGAs to give 12 months to June result of 1-6% increase.

Data indexed to start 2009.\nAccording to the last period of data, the Hunter is still experiencing price increases that are outstripping the state and Greater Sydney median for most LGAs. The data below is for the median weekly rent for 3-bedroom stand-alone houses in the 6 months to June 2023. No data point is reported for Dungog and the Upper Hunter Shire due to low volumes of rentals in the last period. Singleton has had the largest increase with a 7% price increase in 6 months.\nThe NSW median price increase was 0%, whilst Greater Sydney had an increase of around 2% over the 6 months. However, rent increases have abated. In the previous period (to March 2023), median rent increases were 13% in the Upper Hunter, 6% in Port Stephens, 5% in Maitland and 4% in Newcastle and Cessnock.\n\n\nData source: NSW Govt Rent and Sales Report\n\nFor more detail on the Hunter Insights Dashboard, please contact the Institute for Regional Futures\n\n* The data presented here for the Hunter Region includes the local government areas (LGAs) of Cessnock, Dungog, Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Mid-Coast, Muswellbrook, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Singleton and Upper Hunter.

    "text": "Geography of Jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time, knowledge-producing jobs in Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, such as those in the professional and information services, outnumber goods generating jobs, like manufacturing and mining. The Hunter’s changing employment profile highlighted an urgent need to focus planning and investment towards building cross-sector human capital.\nIn this presentation, we provide the background to the second Hunter Insight Series, presented at the University of Newcastle in May 2023.\n\nWatch the Presentation here\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThis work leverages the decades of data, knowledge, and insights afforded by the Hunter Research Foundation (HRF)as part of the Hunter Insight series. Here the focus is on the evolving geography of jobs and its crucial role in shaping planning policies within the Hunter region.\nWe’ll look at some of the current spatial and sectoral characteristics of the Hunter’s workforce and consider some key lessons from around the globe about the potential challenges certain trends pose for the Hunter. We will also highlight areas to focus on that can enable our distinct, yet inextricably connected communities to thrive, wherever they are in the region.\n\nLabour Markets to LGAs:\n\nFirstly, we need to understand the different statistical geographies relevant for the Hunter.\nThe Census Data and other datasets produced by the ABS are underpinned spatially by Statistical Areas (SAs). Of these, we’ll be looking at data for SA Level 4 geographies – these are the largest sub-state regions and have been designed to represent labour markets, or groups of labour markets.\nThere are 107 SA4 regions in Australia, 3 of which cover the Hunter as it is defined in the Hunter Regional Plan 2041, but, as you can see by the map below, these don’t line up with Local Government Area boundaries.\nAlso because we’re leveraging the Hunter Research Foundation’s time series, today we’ll be looking only at the data for the SA4 covering the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie LGAs, and the blue SA4 covering the rest of the Hunter excluding most of the MidCoast LGA.\n\n\nUnemployment:\n\nMost recently, our unemployment rates have been at record low levels, dropping from about 9% at the middle of the pandemic, we have now been below 4% for almost a year.\nRemarkably, in the mining areas of the Hunter this got down to less than 2.5% at the end of last year.\nThe 4% benchmark shown in This graph below is an indicator of ‘effectively zero’ unemployment, or the healthiest an economy can get.\nRegionally, we are in a strong place, employment-wise.\n\n\nEmployed Persons:\n\nThe graph below shows the long-term employment trends of the region compared to NSW. It illustrates the Hunter’s strong level of employment resilience.\nThis resilience stems from a sectoral structure that is uniquely diverse when compared with other regions in Australia. On top of a strong historical base in resources and manufacturing, we also have established and strong capabilities in education, tourism, health, and defence.\nHidden in the data here are the lived experiences of different economic shocks, like the closure of BHP in 1999 and more recently, the pandemic. The trendline doesn’t fully describe the day-to-day experience those events had on people around the region, but collectively they demonstrate an ability to manage change and move forward stronger.\n\n\nLong-Term Structural Change:\n\nThe graph below shows the change in employment sectors in the Hunter over the last decade. The figure shows10-year data because it provides a clear picture of what has been a slow but steady shift of decline in sectors that still are central to the Hunter’s identity – mining, manufacturing, and agriculture, and an upward shift in in service-related jobs.\nThis long-term structural change can still experience short term fluctuations, for example recent spikes in mining jobs in 2017/18 and troughs in education jobs during COVID. But the long term shift is clear, and continuing.\n\n\nRegions are Diverse and Unique Places:\n\nThe Hunter is emblematic of challenges facing regional development globally.\nResearch from around the world describes global shifts in employment and trends that are reshaping the geography of jobs. This is an important influencer of investment decisions for: households – where we choose to live, businesses – where we choose to locate, the flow of goods to target market, and the infrastructure underpinning everything. It is in this way that the geography of jobs shapes the formation and function of cities.\nInternationally, the global financial crisis started the shift, although that wasn’t felt acutely here in Australia.\nBut COVID was the earthquake that radically transformed work/life decisions – here and around the world. This shift was thought to be a panacea for populating regions and there was a lot of speculation about the decline of large capital cities and the rise of regional Australia.\n\n\nHousing:\n\nWhat better way to examine population shift than housing?\nWhile we did see a move towards nearly every region across the country, we are now seeing that not every person decided to make regions their home.\nThe cliff in the vacancy rates here show’s people relocating to the Hunter and the Central Coast during the pandemic. While we won’t have time to go into depth on this topic today, the difference in the rates of recovery between the two regions is important – the Hunter was a high-demand, supply-driven market area before the pandemic, and we continue to be an attractive place to choose today.\nIn combination with extremely low levels of employment, and a high rate of job vacancies still to fill, this is a problem we will need to fix quickly.\n\n\nRegions Matter:\n\nIt was during COVID that the Institute for Regional Futures launched Regions Matter – a national research program exploring what makes regional places attractive.\nThis is a survey-based piece of research with national coverage, providing us insights from over 3,000 households. We sampled three Capital Cities – Brisbane, Sydney, and Perth – and 18 regional areas across NSW, QLD, VIC, and TAS.\nFor the Institute, this allows us to complement the Hunter Research Foundation economic data with social research, giving us insights relevant to policy advocacy across the environmental, cultural, and local government domains.\nIt allows us to understand community sentiments around major agenda-setting issues like the importance of place and belonging, reasons for moving or staying put, and hopes and fears for the future.\nOn one hand, the Regions Matter data tells us what we probably already know intuitively. People have an almost romantic view of regions as more affordable, freer, and socially connected places to be in theory, but hesitate on practical things like job prospects, pay levels and the notion that they won’t fit in.\nAnd, perhaps the timing of our survey – preceded by fires, plagues, and floods has captured the idea that regions are dangerous places to live.\nWorryingly, only a quarter of people surveyed felt government was steering us towards a better future.\n\n\nLong View:\n\nIf you watched Back to the Future and giggled at what 2020 looked like in the 1980s, this one is for you. Reports prepared by the Hunter Research Foundation and Deloitte Access Economics twently years ago had these predictions for 2010-2020ish period.\n\nLook familiar?\nIt may seem like we’re running at full-pelt at the moment, but certainly can’t say we weren’t aware of some of the challenges we’re now facing. It’s certainly a different perspective when it’s a lived experience rather than a crystal ball idea.\nBack then, we were advised to find solutions to manage expected population growth, prepare for eventual mine closures, be aware an emerging skills shortage in the context of the increasingly service-based economy, identify our local responses to anticipated changes in energy policies and the eventual decarbonisation of economies around the world, and figure out how to make the most of ‘region-shaping’ infrastructure – which, at the time was the roll out of the NBN and the soon-to-open Hunter Expressway.\nAll of these are still front of mind (including the Hunter Expressway and NBN), and many are now the subject of exciting new agendas but we don’t have much – or in some cases – any understanding or examples of how that will play out in our day-to-day practice.\nWhat these still-relevant predictions say is that we have been going through this structural shift for such a long time that we don’t even notice it anymore. Kind of like how many of us felt when we tried to put our work clothes on again for the first time after lockdown.\nPost COVID, we really are in unchartered territory. We can no longer rely confidently on looking back in order to visualise our future.\nIn the Hunter, regional planning previously hinged on a physical asset: coal mine, manufacturer, viticulture, university, hospital. The good jobs that flowed from these assets could be monitored, projected, planned around. These, we are familiar with.\nIncreasingly, the world is moving away from a physical capital based-economy to a human capital based-economy. People are fickle right? They can and do change jobs and homes so monitoring, evaluating, and planning around this new type of economy is far more difficult.\nThere is no one ‘right planning’ solution – in fact there are a multitude of possible futures for our region - the consequences ‘wrong planning’ could be devastating for some, simply based on their postcode.\n\nUS as a case study\n\nEnrico Moretti is a researcher in the fields of labour economics and urban economics and is a Professor of Economics at the University of California in Berkeley.\n\nIn his book The New Geography of Jobs, Moretti posits that there are three Americas.\nAt one extreme are the brain hubs with a well-educated labour force and a strong innovation sector. Their workers are among the most productive, creative, and best paid on the planet.\nAt the other extreme are places once dominated by traditional manufacturing, which are declining rapidly, losing jobs and residents.\nIn the middle are several cities that could go either way.\nFor the past 40 years, the three Americas have been growing apart at an accelerating rate causing growing geographic disparities across all aspects of life, from health and longevity to family stability and political engagement.\nBut the winners and losers aren’t necessarily who you’d expect. Moretti’s research shows that you don’t have to be a scientist or an engineer to thrive in one of these brain hubs.\nAmong the beneficiaries are the workers who support the ‘idea-creators’—the carpenters, hair stylists, personal trainers, lawyers, doctors, teachers and the like. Moretti has shown that for every new innovation job in a city, five additional non-innovation jobs are created, and those workers earn higher salaries than their counterparts in other cities.\nDealing with this split—supporting growth in the hubs while arresting the decline elsewhere—is a key challenge.\n\n\nChanging employment structure in the Hunter\n\nThe Hunter is unique in Australia because it has all of these features layered over each other in a concentrated geographic area.\nThe current mindset of planning and policy are more familiar with place-based interventions around physical assets. It’s easy to see progression of mining up the Hunter Valley and the continual export via the Hunter Valley Coal Chain network and Port of Newcastle, underpinned by specialist mining service hubs along that corridor.\nFor decades we’ve been watching the gradual nudge of the region’s labour market away from goods producing towards knowledge producing activities.\nThis figure below shows, for the Hunter excluding Newcastle and Lake Macquarie SA4, the stead downward trend in goods-producing jobs like mining and manufacturing and knowledge-producing jobs since 1999. Here (and in later figures) knowledge jobs are defined as Information, Media and Communications; and professional, scientific, and technical services.\n\nThis next figure below shows a different pace of change in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie SA4, which this year, for the first time has finally reached a crossing point which will shape our next chapter. For the first time Newcastle and Lake Macquarie have more people in knowledge industries than goods industries.\n\nThe figure below visualises the change in goods-producing jobs like mining and manufacturing (shown in orange) and knowledge-producing jobs (shown in blue) between 2011 and 2021 by LGA.\nWhy is this important? Because it suggests we now need to focus on curating a different kind of economy, one that allows businesses to ‘agglomerate’. This takes us from being an area where smart people live to an area that is leveraging innovation to drive productivity. It’s the productivity as opposed to the availability of jobs that provides a collective social and economic lift.\n\n\nMoretti’s three forces of attraction\n\nMoretti describes three forces of attraction to create an innovation economy – that is, the pull-factor a business has on attracting other businesses. These are: - Labour market thickness - The presence of an ecosystem for innovation - Knowledge spillovers.\n\n\nHigh skill knowledge jobs\n\nWe know that people with higher education levels have more ability to move. This tends to be around jobs. Regions Matter research reinforces this.\nA thick labour market is on that has the depth and diversity to appeal to households at any stage of life.\nWe currently have a diverse base of potential jobs to choose from, but not a thick labour market by comparison to Capital Cities, but Newcastle and Lake Macquarie pull out in front of all regional areas across Australia.\n\n\nHigh skill knowledge jobs\n\nWe certainly see, geographically, the agglomeration factors happening in the more urbanised Greater Newcastle / Lower Hunter area, namely in Newcastle and Lake Macquarie.\nWhat we lack in depth across the Region, we make up for in anchors available to the Region – a sea port, airport, uni, hospital and more recently, Australia’s largest customer-owned banking system. Each of these is re-positioning itself in its own way today.\nPolicy / planning challenge for the Hunter: How do we create greater depth in the labour market to attract and build knowledge powerhouses?\n\n\nMoretti’s three forces of attraction – 2. Ecosystem\n\nMoretti’s second force of attraction is the presence of an innovation ecosystem. Where successful places are experiencing decline, it is essential to keep this alive because it can be re-positioned but it can’t be recreated from scratch.\nThe ecosystem includes finance/funding, legal support, tech and management consulting, and as required logistics, repair, engineering.\nSome lament the growing dominance of the services sector but these are the workers who support the ‘idea-creators’.\nAnd the third force of attraction is knowledge spillover – which is inextricably tied to place.\nAnecdote: Moretti’s research showed that for every academic citation, researchers more likely to cite researchers they know rather that someone on other side of world.\nThe Hunter has an established, robust environment for networking and knowledge exchange – across whole community.\nEspecially, higher opportunity for anchors to engage in this way.\nAnecdote: Soccer example – and importance of local-level profiles (e.g., Merewether v Wallsend)\nPolicy / planning challenge for the Hunter: How do we harness and build this strength to support the creation of a deeper labour market?\n\n\nWhere to from here?\n\nWe have existing strengths in the Hunter: defence, energy, health, education.\nA lot of good work has been done to acknowledge/validate the region’s specialisations (existing and emerging) – now we need to get into the specific needs of businesses.\n\nCase Study: Energy\n\nThere’s a constant local refrain that there is little information on ‘what the jobs are’ in new energy. But there is detailed analysis, and a skills shortage that is starting to constrain the pace of the renewable energy build out.\nSo why is it hard to visualise what these jobs are? The simplest reason is that most of the best resource, and the jobs, associated with the first part of the energy transition – building lots of renewables – is somewhere else. It’s happening in North Western and Western NSW, but we can’t see it from here.\nThis figure below shows, locationally, the locations of the Renewable Energy Zones announced for NSW overlayed on where coal mining jobs have traditionally been. On the right, the low resolution graphs (sorry), give us forecasts in the employment expected by technology (utility batteries in purple, wind in green, and solar in red) on the top right, and on the bottom showing forecasted jobs by project phase.\nThe opportunities for the Hunter will come, but generation builds will happen in the most prospective resource areas first. And the sectors where our competitive advantages are strongest – manufacturing, hydrogen, and offshore wind – are subject to intense competition and are essentially the second or third stages of the transition.\nThat gives us time to build the skills and ecosystem, if we are clever and deliberate.\n\n\nCase Study: Energy\n\nThe other obvious reality that is now increasingly being discussed is that the skills requirements will change as the economy responds to net zero imperatives.\nA recent report by a collaboration between CSIRO, major industrial emitters and climate analytics organisations lays this out starkly. As the chart shows, we’ll need a lot more electricians, and a lot less miners, by 2050.\nThe risk of blind pursuits of specialisations at the neglect of all else is that we stifle opportunity by putting all of our eggs into a limited number of baskets.\nLabour demand can be created around producing goods. But you can only see a cluster emerging in hindsight.\nAnecdote: ‘Big push’ initiatives – e.g., Freemont, California’s answer to Detroit – following their shock managed to grow ‘green shoots’ in solar panels. People said you couldn’t throw a frisbee in Freemont without hitting a solar company. But all it took was the main solar employer to back a technology that didn’t take off and the entire cluster evaporated.\nWhen we think about physical assets as anchors we need to ask: - Is the company going to succeed on its own? - Is the industry going to create a thickness in the labour market? - Will it create an ecosystem around it? - Will it create knowledge spill over so other companies will be attracted to the region?\nThis example is a challenge for highly capable venture capitalists, yet we expect policy makers to do this with public money. Often this manifests as competition between regions or local areas within regions for talent, funding, and other resources. Hyper-competition often causes us to lose sight of the ultimate outcome (seeing the forest for the trees).\n\n\nRegion re-shaping\n\nWe’ve now planned and nation-built our way into a new possible future, but everything hinges around what we hang off the places we’ve picked.\nThis figure below shows some very important places around NSW in their own right. For our part of the story, we’ve got an established artery (shown in yellow) with the world’s most efficient system exporting coal as a critical ongoing economic engine.\n\n\nRegion re-shaping\n\nThis figure below shows the new land-based planning initiatives, underpinned by major public investments in infrastructure. The Grey boxes are our Special Activation Precincts, and the orange are Renewable Energy Zones.\n\n\nRegion re-shaping\n\nAnd below we see the rail connections being constructed right now. This is an amazing physical framework for growth. But it also now creates a new playing field for competition.\nHow do we focus policy design around human capital in a way that makes sense for all of us in the long run, rather than a few of us right now?\nBig push doesn’t work for human capital because it is harder to ‘see’ in monitoring and evaluating success (can’t manage what you can’t measure)\nIreland, Israel and Taiwan have made this shift and all exhibited measurable success with a big push to building their human capital – these are exceptional cases but tell a story around the power of investing in people.\nInstead need to invest in a way that makes it safe to try and fail – e.g., research, partnerships, living labs, etc.  all of which we have in the Newcastle / Lake Mac geography.\n\n\nRegion re-shaping\n\nBut government policy design is based around ‘planning boundaries’ – all agencies have these and I’m just going to pick on planning boundaries.\nThis figure below shows the evolution of regional planning boundaries since the first suite of Regional Strategies and Regional Strategic Land Use Plans were introduced. These documents are important because they focus energy and investment on places.\nOver the last two decades, the Hunter has been three, then one, and now two ‘regions’ for the purpose of implementing planning responses to government policy.\nThe Six Cities region concept offers opportunities for the Hunter that we have never seen before. As planning takes shape, it will bring the Lower Hunter with it.\nThe data tells us that the Newcastle Lake Macquarie area is already pulling ahead in terms of economic shifts. Lessons from elsewhere show us there is a real potential to amplify and widen the disparity between the lower Hunter and the rest of the region if we don’t proactively plan to mitigate this.\nThe type and timing of policy decisions in this geography will need to acknowledge the type and timing of policy decisions in the rest of the Hunter – and acknowledge that, from a labour market / social perspective, this ‘outer frame’ is inextricably linked to the rest of the Hunter.\n\n\nKey Takeouts\n\nWe need an agreed framework for different policy responses that meet the needs of different parts of the Hunter:\n\nBrain Hub – to boost an already thriving ecosystem that underpins innovation in key sectors through investment in research, partnerships, etc.\nDeclining manufacturing – we have already lost ecosystems to sustain physical anchors. Big push initiatives around these assets may still work – but it’s always a gamble between it being a temporary crutch or a jump start for an economy.\nPlaces that could go either way – need to be nurtured to sustain and pivot the remnants of any ecosystem before it’s lost. Revitalisation areas\n\nNecessity is the mother of invention. Innovation happens because we need it to. The Hunter is so unique in so many ways that it has historically been the testbed for new ideas. One of its unique characteristics is that it’s not a Capital City but it’s also set apart from all other regions in Australia. Let’s make it a test bed for policy innovation to drive planning excellence."

    "text": "Structural Change in the Hunter\nBroadly, Australia’s employment structure is comprised of 50% population servicing jobs – such as retail, administration, construction and utilities – and 30% government funded services, such as health and education. The other 20% of jobs are split equally between tradeable goods – mining, manufacturing and agriculture – and tradeable, ‘knowledge’ services – such as IT, research, advisory and technical services.\nThe ratio of jobs in tradeable goods vs knowledge services in the Hunter is changing. For the first time, we are seeing knowledge jobs being greater than goods jobs in the Newcastle region.\nTradeable goods – largely mining but also with material manufacturing and agriculture shares – have reduced from 30% of jobs in 1999 to 18% in February 2023, although this is still about double the national percentage.\nThis reduced share in the Hunter Balance has largely been taken up by government funded service jobs (7 percentage points), with small contributions from knowledge and private sector population servicing jobs.\nNewcastle and Lake Macquarie follows a similar pattern to the Australian average, while the other areas of the Hunter have double the tradeable goods jobs, and half the knowledge jobs, compared to the national picture. \nOver the past 25 years, jobs in mining, manufacturing and agriculture have gradually shrunk as a proportion of total jobs across the country, with corresponding increases in government funded services, and in knowledge type jobs.\nA finer grained regional analysis shows that Newcastle & Lake Macquarie recently hit an inflection point, where the number of people employed in producing tradeable goods was exceeded for the first time by knowledge based services that are theoretically tradeable – that is, can draw income from servicing demand beyond the immediate regional population.\n\n\n\nHunter Regional\n\n\nHunter excluding Newcastle and Lake Mac\n\n\nNewcastle and Lake Macquarie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData source: ABS Labour Force, Australia, Detailed."
