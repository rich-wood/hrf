Delivering more affordable, quality housing is one of Australia's most
wicked problems, and industry and governments at all levels are
committing significant resources to address chronic shortages.

In this presentation, the Institute of Regional Future's Director of
Research Programs, Amanda Wetzel, provides insights into the global
nature of this problem. It is imperative that we broaden the current
narrative around land use and supply, to the need to establish a
holistic system that connects housing, infrastructure and place across
the spectrum of government and industry.

The content of this work was presented at the third Hunter Insight
Series, presented at the University of Newcastle in October 2023.

## Summary:

This presentation outlines the profound housing crisis currently faced
by Australia and the critical need for systemic reform. It draws
parallels between the Australian situation and international responses
to the global housing crisis. By examining historical initiatives, the
presentation highlights the continuity of housing challenges throughout
the years. The inefficiencies in the existing housing planning and
delivery system in New South Wales are exposed, emphasizing the urgent
need for transformation. Key issues are 1) the misalignment between
projections and targets; 2) the inadequacy of local government areas as
housing market areas; and 3) the misconception that rezoning land
guarantees supply. We emphasise the importance of adopting a housing
market area approach, considering internal migration patterns, and
embracing stakeholder engagement for adaptive management. Systemic
improvements are urgently required to deliver sustainable solutions and
avoid future housing crises.

## Introduction

The housing crisis is a pressing concern that demands immediate
attention and systemic reform. There are many challenges faced by the
housing sector in Australia, but these have comparative international
responses, and a long history. The existing housing planning and
delivery system in New South Wales has limitations and needs
transformative changes. This presentation addresses key issues, proposes
solutions, and stresses the urgency of adopting a housing market area
approach.

## International experiences

Australia is not alone in facing this housing challenge. Governments
across the globe have been taking similarly drastic measures. One such
case is Ontario, Canada, where the reactions to their proposed solutions
closely mirrored the discourse here in Australia. The enormity of the
changes being proposed, both here and abroad, have been genuinely
unprecedented.

## History repeating

The housing crisis is not a recent phenomenon; it has deep historical
roots. The Australian Housing Conference in 1982 serves as a case in
point. A pamphlet from the conference illustrates the longevity of the
crisis with a number of familiar and recurring themes raised, including:

-   a large backlog of neglected housing needs,

-   growing homelessness and reliance on marginal forms of housing,

-   rising interest rates excluding people from home ownership,

-   overcrowded private rental markets, and

-   long waitlists for public housing."

![](slides/slide3.png)

## Where to start?

More Government money than ever has been allocated to deliver
housing...land dedications, faster approvals, infrastructure,
construction skills and capacity building have been prioritised.
However, before we pour billions of dollars into the system and hope for
better outcomes, it's worth pausing for a minute to check whether the
system we're all working away tirelessly within is setting us up for
success.

![](slides/slide4.png)

## NSW Planning Framework

In practice the 'heart beat' of the NSW Population projections are
circulated through the system by a range of policy directives. The 'main
artery' for planning goes via Regional Plans to Local Strategic Planning
Statements to be operationalised. One of the hallmark characteristics of
the system in NSW is how long it takes an idea to translate into changes
on the ground -- which can be anything from 5 to 15 years (or more).
That's because this system is linear, complex, and relies on several
interdependencies. We must ask ourselves whether this sets us up for the
rapid responses to the housing crises that we urgently need?

![](slides/slide5.png)

## Key Truths

Three fundamental truths must be acknowledged for effective planning:

-   **Projections Are Not Targets:** Population projections, while
    vital, fluctuate over time, demanding a flexible approach to housing
    planning.

-   **Local Government Areas Are Not Housing Market Areas:** To
    understand the housing market's needs, it is imperative to define
    housing market areas that transcend local government boundaries.

-   **Rezoning Does Not Guarantee Supply:** Rezoning land is only one
    part of the solution; adequate infrastructure and systemic support
    are equally crucial.

![](slides/slide6.png)

## Projections aren't targets

One of the key drivers of housing demand is population growth so it
makes sense that the State-wide population projections, published by the
NSW government, are in the planners' toolkit. As part of the 'Common
Planning Assumptions', the projections are required to inform state
agencies' service and asset planning, and Councils' local strategies.

But how do these projections perform over time? The Hunter Research
Foundation Centre dataset includes historic Government projections. This
slide below uses those to show how the 'growth story' we tell ourselves
about the region has changed in less than a decade. The hatched columns
are the projected population levels, as updated every 3 years since
2016. Where we thought we'd grow to by 2036 back in 2019 (shown in
yellow) was 63,000 people less than what was last projected in 2022
(shown in red). The solid blue tracks how the Hunter's population has
actually grown according to census data since 2006. The trendline shows
how close we're tracking against what was projected based on past
performance. This indicates that it is entirely possible that we could
achieve higher growth levels than have previously been projected.

![](slides/slide8.png)

## NSW Implied dwellings

Understanding how many houses we need to accommodate that growth is not
easy algebra. But this is given to us in the number of 'implied
dwellings' published alongside the population projections.

The dwellings projections are based on top down assumptions like
household formation and bottom up assumptions like how much housing the
existing zoned land can deliver.

This next slide singles out Newcastle and Lake Macquarie -- the two
largest local government areas in the Hunter by population. Like the
slide before, it shows how much the projected dwellings have changed
since 2016 --by around 5,000 houses in Lake Macquarie. The same data for
Maitland would show a difference of around 12,000 houses. This is a
fast-moving target to try and operationalise in a linear, complex,
interdependent system!

Unlike the population slide before, the actual versus projected
dwellings trends indicate we could fall short of the number of houses we
expect to require. If that is indeed a shortfall, it compounds every
year, but that growing historic deficit isn't picked up as additional
need anywhere in our planning system -- the updated projections each
year keep us looking forward to future need, not historic needs. So, our
'in practice' target is never giving us the full picture.

![](slides/slide9.png)

The next three slides help illustrate what that oversight means in the
Hunter's 'lived experience'.

## Rental Vacancy

Here we have SQM data showing rental vacancy rates going back to 2010.
Typically, a 3% benchmark is used to indicate a healthy market -- one
where tenants and landlords can have fair negotiations about things like
rent and living conditions. The data shows that while the Hunter reached
up an almost touched that 3% benchmark in mid-2015, the reality is that
our region has an entire generation of people who have never experienced
what it is like to live in a fair and accessible housing market.

![](slides/slide10.png)

## Homelessness

The next slide shows the rise in homelessness for our Region over the
last 20 years. The chart is normalised to the 2001 levels for the
Hunter, NSW, and Australia. It shows our Region's rate of homelessness
has almost doubled in the last 20 years. And, while the national and
state levels reduced in the last census period, our homelessness rates
continued to grow.

![](slides/slide11.png)

## Overcrowding

Hidden forms of homelessness are also on the rise, which looks like:
crisis accommodation, people living temporarily in boarding houses or
caravan parks, or staying periodically between various friends' houses.

Here in the Hunter, we have a rising problem of overcrowding.

Typically, we would expect to find overcrowding is more common in
certain segments of the population -- including migrant families,
students, and First Nations households. Some of this is culturally
driven, but much of it is not particularly where it's prolonged or
identified as 'severe', which is defined in the census as -- households
that would need 4 or more additional bedrooms to meet their needs.

This next slide shows the spatial inequalities emerging across the
Region, with Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, MidCoast, and Cessnock showing
the highest concentrations.

![](slides/slide12.png)

**We urgently need to move beyond relying on projections as our 'in
practice' housing target and instead develop more robust planning
methodologies with a built-in level of contingency to truly address
pre-existing and future housing needs.**

## Local Government Areas are not housing markets

An awful lot of expectation and responsibility to deal with the housing
crises falls to Councils -- they're involved in setting the planning
controls, assessing and approving residential developments, and
delivering local infrastructure and services.

But allocating a portion of growth to a local government area doesn't
give us the full picture of what 'the market' needs, because local
government areas are not housing markets.

## Scottish Planning Model

If we're going to think about whether our system is designed for
success, it is worth looking at other approaches. Given the almost
global experience of a housing crisis, we can't point to anywhere as
'best practice'. But if we're going to rely on localised approaches, we
can look at systems like Scotland's for lessons.

Key to this approach is...that it starts by defining **local housing
market areas**, to set the frame for strategic planning and policy
setting. From there, it mandates a governance arrangement to determine
needs and agree targets, before operationalising these through policy or
planning controls.

Defining a market for a good is about understanding where a level of
price uniformity exists in the context of transport cost. The difference
being that in 'goods' markets, it is the product is that moves... but in
a housing market, it's the people that move.

So, here at the Institute, we've been playing around for the last
several weeks to draw on examples from literature and practice,
including guidelines from the UK and housing studies by SGS here in
Australia to try and re-imagine a different spatial framework that might
help us understand housing market needs more robustly.

![](slides/slide14.png)

## Case for housing market areas

We rely so heavily on journey-to-work data in planning, but it is
evident across Australia that centres-based planning is become less
relevant due to the decentralisation of jobs and rise of more 'From
home' options to access goods and services (think home schooling, Amazon
delivery, and Uber Eats).

Looking at buyer/renter behaviour we know that people aren't necessarily
tethered to the address of their employer. It's a complex and often
highly personalised choice model ...just think about your own
motivations the last time you moved -- was it:

1.  To get into your preferred school catchment?
2.  To be closer to your parents?
3.  To get closer to the beach?

And here in the Hunter, many households have traditionally opted to
locate themselves between more than one centre to meet their specific
needs -- for example much of Maitland's growth has been attributed to
dual-income households with one person working in mining in the Upper
Hunter and the other in health or education in the Lower Hunter.

So rather than journey to work, we drew from internal migration patterns
using data from the last two census periods. That allows this map to
tell us where people who are already local and need to change their
house (but not uproot their whole lives) are more likely to search to
meet their need.

This approach is different from the journey to work approach because it
is likely to reflect more of the social, price-tag, and place-attachment
drivers influencing people's decisions about where to live.

The different colours show these migration-based 'housing market areas',
and the white lines are local government area boundaries. This modelling
showed time and again that in reality, people's choice about where to
live doesn't stop at LGA boundaries.

![](slides/slide15.png)

The place-based solutions we urgently need to address the housing crises
must be grounded in action, not just aspiration. Taking a housing market
rather than LGA approach do this would make more sense by allowing:

1.  Data to be collected and analysed at a level where the trends make
    sense in relation to the research questions you want to ask,
2.  Governance to happen at an appropriate scale, and
3.  Solutions (be they policy or planning) to be suitably
    contextualised.

This configuration still needs some testing (and some more modelling in
the MidCoast area), but we can already see a few advantages to the
approach.

Just picking up on Maitland in brown -- mover behaviour shows a
preference area reaching into both the Newcastle and Port Stephens local
government areas and, I would hypothesise, the southern parts of Dungog
around Clarence Town if we went more granular than the underlying SA2s
we used as building blocks allowed.

We believe using these areas to frame housing needs assessments and
governance arrangements would be far more effective than our current
approach but putting this approach into practice, however, would require
government funding and attention.

I would argue this type of systems-based improvement is just as urgent a
priority as addressing our infrastructure backlog if we truly want to
deliver sustainable solutions.

## Actual v Projected dwellings (again)

Why aren't we able to supply in line with market demands?

Of course there is a problem with delivering the infrastructure new
projects need -- There has been a lot of media coverage recently on the
cost of infrastructure to service new growth fronts, particularly in
Western Sydney and the outer edges of Melbourne.

But this has been a Hunter-specific problem for decades. Misalignment in
the funding and delivery of infrastructure -- for a long period of time
the issue was with Hunter Water's trunk infrastructure, and more
recently the literal roadblock is proving to be Transport for NSW.

Learning from that example, it was the organisational re-think that
occurred within Hunter Water that made the difference in so far as they
accepted their role in the Region's growth story and repositioned their
own strategic planning capacity and capabilities to do things
differently. This is a lesson for all Government agencies responsible
for assets that enable new housing projects to go ahead.

But, beyond infrastructure, there is a bigger, more systemic failure
which is that we aren't planning in the right way to truly deliver
place-based solutions. We don't even know the full picture of what we
need to operationalise.

![](slides/slide17.png)

So, does it make sense to push billions of dollars of public sector
money through this system and expect to achieve the results we need?

## Where to from here?

-   Taking the time to work on the system now, and pivot into a more
    **stakeholder engaged adaptive management approach,** will better
    set us up for success moving forward.

-   So, as we embark on an unprecedented level of spending to deliver
    the housing Australia needs, we call on Governments at all levels to
    use at least some of that on system improvements now to avoid
    standing here in another 40 years, recalling the 1982 Australian
    Housing Conference's harrowing scope to current crisis in the
    housing sector.
