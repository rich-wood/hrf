    "text": "Output Multiplier\nThe output multiplier quantifies the ripple effects of increased output in a specific sector. When a particular industry in the Hunter Region experiences growth, it generates additional income and demand for goods and services, which in turn stimulates other sectors. The output multiplier provides insights into the overall economic output and the interconnectedness of industries within the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe largest multiplier is for Electricity generation and distribution, which means this sector generates the most economic activity in the region. This relatively large value means that it has supply-chain links to other sectors in the region (such as coal mining). The smallest multiplier is for Clothing manufacturing, which reflects the fact that most clothing is imported into the region."

Historically, a key challenge for policymakers is to achieve a low rate of unemployment without fuelling excessive increases in wages growth and inflation.
